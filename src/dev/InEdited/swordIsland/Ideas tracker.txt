#One of two tracks

## Track one
The game can take place on a small island to have a battleground last standing style game
* requires a lot of networking and creating a server
* less work on the world map and no NPCs

## Track two
The game can take the route of a small RPG game
* Requires way much more work on the assets and map
* more work on creating NPCs
