# SwordIsland

A game built as a University project for the Computer Programming 2 course I'm currently taking.

The game is supposed to take the form of a "last man standing" battle royale form with medieval feel.

Using old pokemon games tiles style and entity system

___

The game is built in pure Java using Swing

```
The resources found in the res directory are still not the final ones they are for experimenting and building the base game
```
## Achieved till now
* Working game loop
* A general handler class
* A full animation through sprite sheets
* A tile system
* An entity system/structure
* Input managers
* States handler
* Assets handler
* A general working movement system
* A working camera that follows the player and has limits
* pixel perfect collision
* collision with entities

## To be done
* A melee combat system
* Items droppings
* Menu state
* Simple ingame UI
* Items pickup
* Inventory system
* Mouse + keyboard combat instead of keyboard only one
* Network system to play multiplayer
* Long range combat system
* Audio files and background music

## Trying to keep the game as well structured as possible for this project.
